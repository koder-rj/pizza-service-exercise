Create a Pizza Service:
1. Takes an Order and returns order number if order is accepted. Throws an exception if order can be taken due to some issues
2. Order consists of size, deliver or pickup, name of customer, list of ingredients, which includes toppings, base and sauce
3. Toppings can be left, right or all. Base and sauce has no such instruction
4. Order has certain restrictions, for small, no more than 3 toppings, etc 
5. Each ingredient has its own inventory in lbs, and based on the size of pizza and portions (1/2, 1), certain quantity is deducted. If inventory is finished, pizza order can not be filled
